# Social Network API

## Description

This project is a RESTful API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The API is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose as the ODM. It provides endpoints for users, thoughts, reactions, and friends management.
